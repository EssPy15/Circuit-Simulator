# Circuit Simulator 

In this project we have made a simple RLC circuit simulator that uses the concept of cut set and tie set to find the value in current and voltage in each branch of the circuit. To use enter the circuit in the form of graph with nodes and branches as edges. Then it will ask what component is in each branch of the circuit enter 0 or value of the equivalent resistance/capacitnace/inductance in the branch or if it has a voltage or current source. The answer will be in the form of a matrix.
